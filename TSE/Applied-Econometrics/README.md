- Empirical Project-The influence of overweight and obesity on healthcare expenditures

  Did the overweight and obesity have a positive impact on the healthcare expenditures? Here we give a confirmed answer “yes”. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data of United States in 2009, we can find that with the augmentation of the BMI(Body Mass Index), the healthcare expenditures increase in the same time, ceteris paribus. There are also several control variables such as socio-demographic and economic characteristics.
