# Applied Econometrics  
Course TSE

## Course Objectives  
The aim of this course is to expose students to the theoretical and practical skills necessary for undertaking applied work in economics and provide them with an opportunity to carry out an empirical project.

## Course Outline
The lectures part of the course is structured into a general introduction that will present the course and discuss the different stages of an empirical project and six sections that will cover some applied topics in different areas of research. The general introduction and a presentation of the six topics will be covered during the first semester (5 lectures in November). In the second semester, students will choose three topics among the six covered and attend lectures on the three topics chosen. In addition to the lectures, computer laboratory tutorial sessions will be organized to give students a chance to analyze data on empirical questions.

## Empirical Project - The influence of overweight and obesity on healthcare expenditures

  Did the overweight and obesity have a positive impact on the healthcare expenditures? Here we give a confirmed answer “yes”. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data of United States in 2009, we can find that with the augmentation of the BMI(Body Mass Index), the healthcare expenditures increase in the same time, ceteris paribus. There are also several control variables such as socio-demographic and economic characteristics.
