########## Objects and Layers ##########

##### base package and ggplot2, part 1 - plot #####
# Plot the correct variables of mtcars
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Change cyl inside mtcars to a factor
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Make the same plot as in the first instruction
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Recall that under-the-hood, factors are simply integer type vectors, 
# so the colors in the second plot are 1, 2, and 3. 
# In the first plot the colors were 4, 6, and 8.

##### base package and ggplot2, part 2 - lm #####
# Basic plot
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Use lm() to calculate a linear model and save it as carModel
carModel <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Call abline() with carModel as first argument and set lty to 2
abline(reg = carModel, lty = 2)

# Plot each subset efficiently with lapply
# You don't have to edit this code
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(carModel, col = x)
  })

# This code will draw the legend of the plot
# You don't have to edit this code
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")
# Notice how the legend had to be set manually.

##### base package and ggplot2, part 3 #####
# Convert cyl to factor (don't need to change)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Example from base R (don't need to change)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)
abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), lty = 2)
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
  })
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")

# Plot 1: add geom_point() to this command to create a scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point()  # Fill in using instructions Plot 1

# Plot 2: include the lines of the linear models, per cyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 1
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)   # Fill in using instructions Plot 2

# Plot 3: include a lm for the entire dataset in its whole
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = 2) + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1))   # Fill in using instructions Plot 3

########## Tidy Data ##########
  
##### Variables to visuals, part 1 #####
# Consider the structure of iris, iris.wide and iris.tidy (in that order)
str(iris)
str(iris.wide)
str(iris.tidy)

# Think about which dataset you would use to get the plot shown right
# Fill in the ___ to produce the plot given to the right
ggplot(iris.tidy, aes(x = Species, y = Value, col = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Measure)

##### Variables to visuals, part 1b #####
# Load the tidyr package
library(tidyr)

# Fill in the ___ to produce to the correct iris.tidy dataset
iris.tidy <- iris %>%
  gather(iris, value = measurement, -Species) %>%
  separate(iris, c("Part", "Measure"), "\\.")

##### Variables to visuals, part 2 #####
# Consider the head of iris, iris.wide and iris.tidy (in that order)
head(iris)
head(iris.wide)
head(iris.tidy)

# Think about which dataset you would use to get the plot shown right
# Fill in the ___ to produce the plot given to the right
ggplot(iris.wide, aes(x = Length, y = Width, col = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Species)
